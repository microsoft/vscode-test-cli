### @vscode/test

> This is an experimental command-line test runner is available. Its API may change as we get feedback on it. Please try it out!

This is an configuration-driver command line runner for [VS Code extension tests](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension). It provides a simple, configuration-driven interface for running tests, and has its own VS Code extension that allows running tests in the UI.

Install with:

```
npm install --save-dev @vscode/test
```

After installing the package, the runner is available as the `vscode-test` CLI. Running it will look for a `.vscode-test.(js/json/mjs)` file relative to the current working directory. You can see the configuration [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-test/blob/main/lib/cli-runner/config.ts). This may be as simple as:

```js
// .vscode-test.mjs
import { defineConfig } from '@vscode/test';

export default defineConfig({ files: 'out/test/**/*.test.js' });
```

Or include more options. For example:

```js
// .vscode-test.mjs
import { defineConfig } from '@vscode/test';

export default defineConfig([
	{
		// Required: Glob of files to load (can be an array and include absolute paths).
		files: 'out/test/**/*.test.js',
		// Optional: Version to use, same as the API above, defaults to stable
		version: 'insiders',
		// Optional: Root path of your extension, same as the API above, defaults
		// to the directory this config file is in
		extensionDevelopmentPath: __dirname,
		// Optional: sample workspace to open
		workspaceFolder: `${__dirname}/sampleWorkspace`,
		// Optional: additional mocha options to use:
		mocha: {
			preload: `./out/test-utils.js`,
			timeout: 20000,
		},
	},
	// you can specify additional test configurations if necessary
]);
```

Tests included with this command line are run in Mocha. You can run the tests simply by running `vscode-test` on the command line. You can view more options with `vscode-test --help`; this command line is very similar to Mocha. For example, to watch and run only tests named "addition", you can run:

```sh
vscode-test --watch 'out/**/*.js' --grep 'addition'
```

#### Debugging

Add or update an `extensionHost` launch-type config with the path to your test configuration:

```diff
{
	"type": "extensionHost",
	"request": "launch",
	"name": "My extension tests",
+	"testConfiguration": "${workspaceFolder}/.vscode-test.js",
	"args": ["--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}"]
},
```
